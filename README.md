## Text to Audio Generation for auto chat platforms with python and Google Text-to-Speech

##This code is part of my project where I generate audio from text in multiple languages for auto chatbots using Python and Google Text-to-Speech.

##Google Text-to-Speech 
is a service provided by Google that converts written text into spoken words. It supports multiple languages and voices, allowing developers to integrate natural-sounding speech synthesis into their applications. The service uses advanced machine learning models to generate high-quality speech, making it useful for a variety of applications, such as accessibility features, virtual assistants, and more.
